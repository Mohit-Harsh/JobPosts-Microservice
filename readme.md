# üìù JobPosts-Spring-React

üöÄ **JobPosts-Spring-React** is a full-stack web development project designed to streamline job postings and applications. Built using modern Java and JavaScript frameworks, this application leverages **Spring Boot** for the backend and **React.js** for the frontend. It uses **RabbitMQ** for handling email messaging queues and **PostgreSQL** as the database, ensuring robust data handling and smooth communication between services.

## üìÇ Project Overview

This project is developed with a microservice architecture, and it is fully containerized using **Docker** and **Docker Compose** for easy deployment. By utilizing **Git** for version control, the development is seamless and scalable.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Job Post**:  
  - Add new job posts with an intuitive form UI.
  - Utilize an **embedded Markdown renderer** that previews job descriptions in real-time.
  - Job posters can design job descriptions in Markdown format, preview, and save them.  
  - Job descriptions maintain the same Markdown styling when viewed by applicants.

- **Job Application**:  
  - Apply to jobs through a streamlined application form.  
  - Each application is stored in the **PostgreSQL** database and added to the `email_queue`.  
  - The **email_queue** is listened to by a dedicated microservice that sends a confirmation email to the applicant.
